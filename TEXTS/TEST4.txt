4 Paul Robertson: The Tomatis method is highly specific form of therapy. At the opposite extreme is a study in Aberdare boysâ€™ school in South Wales. Anne Savan teaches science to special needs children with problems ranging from visual and auditory impairments to autism, Asperger syndrome and epilepsy. What all these children have in common is a lack of coordination. So when she was faced with a particularly large intake of thirteen children she tried playing background music to calm them. This she did for an initial period of five months, and it was pure luck that the tape, which came to hand, was Mozart.
Anne Savan: I found immediately that the children changed. They became focused. They were calm, their work became neater, their work became more productive. They wanted to complete each task.

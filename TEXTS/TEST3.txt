3 Paul Robertson: The late Alfred Tomatis’s principles are practised wolrdwide to treat a range of problems such as attention deficit disorder, dyslexia and autism. But the question remains why did he choose Mozart? Alex Smith runs the Listening Centre in Lewes, Sussex.
Alex Smith: We actually filter out frequencies right up to 9000, so we filter out everything below 9000 Hertz. Hearing is a passive concept, listening is active and if we can’t focus our listening as we focus our eyesight, we’re prey to all the sounds SO if you can’t focus your listening you can’t focus specifically on a point and you can’t focus out extraneous sounds. So kids with attention deficit disorder, all the sounds just flood into them and they can’t cut it ou. What this does is restrain the ear to so it can listen properly and if you can focus out what you don’t want to hear.

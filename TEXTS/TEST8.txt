8 Paul Robertson: Mozart was arguably the most precociously gifted child there’s ever been. This is a reason why the 1993 researchers Shaw and Rauscher chose him for their study. The fact that he was composing at the age of four and could write down an entire work without changing a note made his music the prime candidate for their research. In other words, the boy was functioning neurologically at such a high level that this must show through his music. Child development and education specialists today recognize that such a perfect mind comes with it’s own problems. His father, Leopold, was a dominant character and Mozart’s health, behaviour and education would nowadays certainly ring alarm bells. I wonder whether his way of coping with these problems tells us anything about the therapeutic qualities of his music.

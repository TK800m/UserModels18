2 Paul Robertson: One of the world’s foremost advocates of the music and healing connection is Don Campbell. 
Don Campbell: I became aware of Mozart and his effect on learning and communication around 1982, when I met Dr. Alfred Tomatis, and he had spent many years starting research with Mozart, with Beethoven, with Gregorian chant and with many different kinds of music to see if playing music to children with autism and dyslexia and different kinds of speech and communication disorders made any difference. He began to look at the anatomy of music and sound on what interests the brain. 
Paul Robertson: But am I right in thinking that Alfred Tomatis’s work doesn’t largely or exclusively rely upon merely listening to music but it’s listening to music in a very special and filtered way?
Don Campbell: Exactly. And if anything, he says the Mozart violin concertos are the healthiest music in the world.

 7 Paul Robertson: Is it possible to postulate what might be happening and which areas of the brain are processing information in such a way that this happens?
Oliver Sacks: Er, well, one could certainly make a guess that the basal ganglia are involved here, these deep nuclei to both sides in the centre of the brain. One knows that this is the part of the brain, which is damaged in people who have Parkinson’s, and the basal ganglia have been called the organs of succession. Their integrity seems to be necessary to have smooth succession of movement or perceptions or thoughts. And it’s almost as if music is providing a sort of prosthesis for the damaged basal ganglia, a sort of substitute for them.

5 Anne Savan: At the end of five months I contacted the University of Reading and we set up a research programme where we would use these children and actually measure physiological parameters in them, to see if there was any difference when the music was being played. And they taught them how to measure their own blood pressure and their body temperature and their respiration rate and their pulse rate, and we made a pupil profile. And they would actually take these measurements at the start of the lesson, twenty minutes into the lesson and the one hour after they had left the lesson. We actually found that there was approximately a ten-percent drop in all of the physiological parameters within twenty minutes of the lesson when there was music playing. Now, I stuck to Mozart because that was the one that was actually having the effect.
